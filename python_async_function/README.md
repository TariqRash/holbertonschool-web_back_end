# Python - Async

## Author
Tariq Rasheed

## Description
This project covers asynchronous programming in Python 3 using `asyncio`. It explores how to write async coroutines, run concurrent tasks, measure runtime, and create asyncio tasks.

## Learning Objectives
- `async` and `await` syntax
- How to execute an async program with `asyncio`
- How to run concurrent coroutines
- How to create asyncio tasks
- How to use the `random` module

## Requirements
- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.9)
- All files use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
- All functions and coroutines are type-annotated
- All files are executable

## Tasks
| Task | File | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 0 | `0-basic_async_syntax.py` | The basics of async |
| 1 | `1-concurrent_coroutines.py` | Execute multiple coroutines concurrently |
| 2 | `2-measure_runtime.py` | Measure the runtime |
| 3 | `3-tasks.py` | Tasks - create asyncio.Task |
| 4 | `4-tasks.py` | Tasks - task_wait_n |
